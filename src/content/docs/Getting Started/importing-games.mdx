import { Icon } from "astro-icon/components";

Excerpt from the official Delta page:

> Delta needs ROMs <Icon name="clarity:cd-dvd-line" size="1.2em" class="inline-icon" /> in order to play games. ROMs are special files containing a game's data. There are many ways to get a game's ROM file, but we recommend using a tool like [GB Operator](https://www.epilogue.co/product/gb-operator) - though you can find other similar tools online.
>
> Once you have a ROM, you can add it to your library by tapping '+' in the top right corner of Delta's main screen. The ROM must have one of the supported file extensions below.
