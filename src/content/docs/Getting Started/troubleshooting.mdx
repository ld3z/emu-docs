## I put a game in my library, but when I go to play it either doesn't run at all or freezes at certain points. What do I do?

If everything else is fine, but you are having trouble with running a game, try downloading from another source first to make sure that the file you are trying to run is not altered. Some ROMs may be corrupted and you will run in difficulties while trying to play them with Delta.

If you are attempting to play a "ROM Hack," you may have trouble. While many "ROM Hacks" will run perfectly fine on Delta, some larger hacks may require you to run with additional software.
