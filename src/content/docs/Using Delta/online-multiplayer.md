Delta uses "community-hosted" Nintendo WFC servers to connect you with other players.

## How to Connect

:::note
You will only need to perform these steps the first time you connect online.
:::

1. Attempt to use online features in a Nintendo WFC-compatible DS game.

2. Tap "Choose Server" on the alert that appears.

3. Choose a server from the list or provide a custom DNS.

:::caution
You can change your server later by going to Delta Settings > Core Settings (Nintendo DS) > WFC Server, but you may need to re-register your friend codes.
:::

4. Tap "Done" in the top right.

5. Restart your game by pressing "Restart" on the alert that appears.

:::danger
Devices on the same Wi-Fi network may not be able to connect to each other. Switch to cellular data (if available) as a workaround.
